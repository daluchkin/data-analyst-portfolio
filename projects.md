<a name="cat-dog-classifier"></a>
## [Cat vs. Dog Classifier Optimization](https://github.com/daluchkin/data-analyst-portfolio/tree/main/08_Cat_Dog_Classifier_Optimization)
*March 2025*\
This project is a personal experiment aimed at improving a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classifying cats and dogs. The main goal was to explore how **Bayesian optimization** (BO) can be used to fine-tune both the architecture and hyperparameters of a CNN, leading to better performance.

**Tools:** Python, Jupyter Notebook, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, tensorflow, keras, data visualization, model building, model evaluation, hyperparameters optimization

<a name="emotions-detector"></a>
## [Human Facial Emotions Detection](https://github.com/daluchkin/data-analyst-portfolio/tree/main/07_Human_Facial_Emotions_Detection)
*February 2025*\
This project focuses on detecting emotions from facial images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on labeled facial expressions to classify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and more. This can be applied in various domains, including human-computer interaction, sentiment analysis, and mental health monitoring.

**Tools:** Python, Jupyter Notebook, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, tensorflow, keras, data visualization, model building, model evaluation.

<a name="mushroom-classifier"></a>
## [Mushroom Classifier](https://github.com/daluchkin/data-analyst-portfolio/tree/main/06_Mushroom_Classifier)
*February 2025*\
The primary goal of this project is to build a robust mushroom classification model that can accurately distinguish between edible and poisonous mushrooms based on their physical attributes.

**Tools:** Python, Jupyter Notebook, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, data cleaning, data wrangling, data visualization, model building, model evaluation.

<a name="medical-insurance-cost"></a>
## [Medical Insurance Cost Prediction](https://github.com/daluchkin/data-analyst-portfolio/tree/main/05_Medical_Insurance_Cost)
*February 2025*\
The project aims to determine the best regression model for predicting medical insurance costs based on various factors such as age, BMI, smoking status, and region. The dataset contains numerical and categorical variables, requiring appropriate preprocessing techniques before model training.

**Tools:** Python, Jupyter Notebook, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, data cleaning, data wrangling, data visualization, model building, model evaluation.

<a name="car4u-car-price-prediction"></a>
## [Cars4u: Car Price Prediction](https://github.com/daluchkin/data-analyst-portfolio/blob/main/04_Car4u_car_price_prediction)
*August 2024*\
The [Car4U dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sukhmanibedi/cars4u) contains data of information about used cars. The Car4u project aimed to build a predictive model for estimating the price of used cars based on various features. This project involved analyzing historical data to identify key factors influencing car prices and developing models to predict these prices accurately.

**Tools:** Python, Jupyter Notebook, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, statsmodels, data cleaning, data wrangling, data visualization, model building, model evaluation.
