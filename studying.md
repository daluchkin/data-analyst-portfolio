## [Machine Learning A-Z: AI, Python & R](https://github.com/daluchkin/machine_learning_course)
*February 2025*

This Machine Learning course provides a structured journey from fundamental concepts to advanced techniques, equipping me with essential data science and AI skills. Designed by experienced Data Scientists, the course simplifies complex theories, algorithms, and programming frameworks, making them accessible through hands-on practice.

To gain a deeper understanding, this section also contains my personal experiments, where I applied and tested different approaches beyond the standard coursework, reinforcing key concepts through practical experience. The following techniques were explored: 

+ **Regression:** Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, SVR, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression
+ **Classification:** Logistic Regression, K-NN, SVM, Kernel SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree Classification, Random Forest Classification
+ **Clustering:** K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering
+ **Association Rule Learning:** Apriori, Eclat
+ **Reinforcement Learning:** Upper Confidence Bound, Thompson Sampling
+ **Natural Language Processing:** Bag-of-words model and algorithms for NLP
+ **Deep Learning:** Artificial Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks
+ **Dimensionality Reduction:** PCA, LDA, Kernel PCA
+ **Model Selection & Boosting:** k-fold Cross Validation, Parameter Tuning, Grid Search, XGBoost
